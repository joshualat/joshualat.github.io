      A couple of weeks ago, I was invited to be one of the judges in Pisay's Research Competition during the 2015 Youth Math Science and Technology Festival. Of course, I accepted the invite since it would be nice to to see Pisay again and see how the scholars of the current generation are doing so far.

      To be honest, I am amazed that some of the IT research projects now are harder than most college research projects.

      Some of the Pisay students already knew SQL, mobile development, and web development.

      The day started with an orientation of how the entire day will look like. We got to see the titles and abstracts of the research papers during the orientation. Each of us had to judge around 15 research projects. The scores we give them would directly affect their final grades as students.

      <br /><br />

      After the orientation, I visited the booths and judged 15 research projects before I asked all the teams the same question, "What problems did you encounter during the execution step?".

      Most of them answered that they encountered something they never expected and they needed more time since they were delayed by the problem.I also got to see some teams unable to complete their projects since they had problems using a new technology which wasn't taught at Pisay. There were also amazing projects which had been planned and executed properly. Finally, there were also great ideas that could actually compete in Startup competitions.

      After 3 to 5 hours of judging projects, the results came out and the winners of the competition were announced. I enjoyed the judging experience and I learned a lot of things there that could help me lead projects as a Scrum Master or Lead Developer.
